The two twin brothers noticed that it was very challenging to get a loan with a  bank, the process was too long, hectic and very manual.

The competitive advantage of Mogo is trading climate positive bitcoin: Mogo plants trees to offset the CO2 that the emissions created from mining the bitcoin. Mogo partnered with Flash Forest to plant trees for every trade made through MogoTrade or every transaction made using Mogo card.

We can also consider companies such as Wealth Simple and Questrade as competitors in regards to the trading platforms.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

The company grew signifcantly thourghout the years. They acquired 1.8 million clients. Their average annual revenues are $60M and currently have 265 employees. The payment volume hit $2.4 billions for 2021. They are acquiring several companies to enforce their operations and product offering, with a 39% ownership of Coinesquare, a major crpto exchange platform. Since Mogo is big on green investing, they have planted 500,000 trees as of 2021.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? 

There is a multitude of core metrics to measure a company like Mogo because they offer a wide range of services due to their status of digital bank. I would split the metrics in two levels macro for the overall company performance and micro for the different products and operations.
Macro-level metrics: Assets under Management, Balance sheet lending revenue, Client Acquisition and member growth, Subscription and Service Revenue.
Micro-level metrics: Website and app traffic, cross-selling rate, time to funding, onboarding and converion rate

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Mogo has a strong client base with an impressive member growth of 64% year over year, which is very competitive in the market. 
They have signficantly less assets under management than the competition though with only $291M while EQ Bank is at $42B, WealthSimple $8.4B, Questrade $25B
50% of the revenue comes from lending while the other 50% comes from subscription (monthly fees for theft protection, and all fees related to interchange fees and mortgages)
The company is spending massively in R&D and technology acquisition/partnership to develop new products: over $200M spent in recent product developments which is almost their current market capitizaltion. $110M invested in Coinsquare and Tetra alone. As a result, profits are not as large as competition but Mogo can take over on the long-term as the leading digital bank in Canada.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

First of all, Mogo needs to implement a chequing accounts so clients can have them as their first and only bank.
I would advise the company to focus and strenghten the prodcuts currently in place in order to cross-sell as much as possible to their impressive 1.8 million clients. 
Some examples would be to offer Buy Now Pay Later features on their MogoCard. The BNPL is currently taking the financial industry by storm and it could attract more millenials. Their MogoCard should also offer the option to be fully digital to enforce that idea of no physical dependecies. 
Mogo can also work on an in-house bitcoin wallet that would give more confidence to crypto investors with options for both cold and hot wallets.
Lastly, I would advise the company to work on innovating a traditional banking prodcuts such as RRSP and as an innovative twist such RRSP contribution to be invested in an ESG friendly portfolio with divends paid in bitcoins.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

I think that these prodcuts and services would allow Mogo to be more competitive as full digital bank but maionly increase their revenue and assets under management that are behind in the industry.
Buy Now Pay Later or Installment payments would bring in more revenue from the interchange fee and acquire more clients.
An innovative RRSP product would also increase the assets under management and maybe bring-in another set of clients.
Bitcoin wallets to attract more active crypto investors.
This FinTech is growing a diverse portfolio of products and they can easily cross-sell products and monetize clients data already available.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

I believe that all the technologies needed for these products are already in place and used by Mogo. They might require more in-house blockchain build with smart contracts for crypto wallets. 
I would also strongly advise to AI & Machine Learning to optimize cross-sell solutions.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

With a database of 1.8 million clients, strong data analysis combined with AI & Machine learning is the best way to leverage the huge amount of data available to monetize and target clients with the right product needs. Mogo will need the right cross-sell strategy to get their clients to fully bank with them. Ideally a client would not need any other company for all their financial and banking needs.
